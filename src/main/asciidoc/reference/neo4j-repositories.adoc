== Introduction

This chapter will point out the features for repository support for Neo4j and the Neo4j-OGM.
This builds on the core repository support explained in <<repositories>>.
So make sure you have got a sound understanding of the basic concepts explained there.

The following table outlines the repositories functionality currently either supported, partially supported or not supported in SDN:

|======================

== Usage

The `Repository` instances are created automatically through Spring and can be autowired into your Spring beans as required.
You don't have to provide an implementation for the interfaces you declared.

.Using basic `Neo4jRepository` CRUD-methods
[source,java]
----
@Repository
public interface PersonRepository extends Neo4jRepository<Person, Long> {}

public class MySpringBean {

   private final PersonRepository repo;

   @Autowired
   public MySpringBean(PersonRepository repo) {
    this.repo = repo;
   }
}

// then you can use the repository as you would any other object
Person michael = repo.save(new Person("Michael", 36));

Optional<Person> dave = repo.findById(123);

long numberOfPeople = repo.count();
----

The recommended way of providing repositories is to define a repository interface per aggregate root and not for every domain class.
The underlying Spring repository infrastructure will automatically detect these repositories, along with additional implementation classes,
and create an injectable repository implementation to be used in services or other Spring beans.

The repositories provided by Spring Data Neo4j build on the composable repository infrastructure in https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/data-commons/docs/current/reference/html/[Spring Data Commons].
These allow for interface-based composition of repositories consisting of provided default implementations for certain interfaces and additional custom implementations for other methods.

Spring Data Neo4j comes with a single `org.springframework.data.repository.PagingAndSortingRepository` specialisation called `Neo4jRepository<T. ID>` used for all object-graph mapping repositories.
This sub-interface also adds specific finder methods that take a _depth_ argument to control the horizon with which related entities are fetched and saved.
Generally, it provides all the desired repository methods.
If other operations are required then the additional repository interfaces should be added to the individual interface declaration.


== Query Methods

=== Query and Finder Methods

Most of the data access operations you usually trigger on a repository will result in a query being executed against the Neo4j database.
Defining such a query is just a matter of declaring a method on the repository interface.

.`PersonRepository` with query methods
====
[source,java]
----
public interface PersonRepository extends PagingAndSortingRepository<Person, String> {

    List<Person> findByLastname(String lastname);                      <1>

    Page<Person> findByFirstname(String firstname, Pageable pageable); <2>

    Person findByShippingAddresses(Address address);                   <3>

    Stream<Person> findAllBy();                                        <4>
}
----
<1> The method shows a query for all people with the given last name.
The query will be derived parsing the method name for constraints which can be concatenated with `And` and `Or`.
Thus the method name will result in a query expression of `{"lastname" : lastname}`.

<2> Applies pagination to a query.
Just equip your method signature with a `Pageable` parameter and let the method return a `Page` instance and we will automatically page the query accordingly.

<3> Shows that you can query based on properties which are not a primitive type.

<4> Uses a Java 8 `Stream` which reads and converts individual elements while iterating the stream.

[[reference_programming_model_annotatedQueries]]
=== Annotated queries

Queries using the Cypher graph query language can be supplied with the `@Query` annotation.

That means a repository method annotated with +
`@Query("MATCH (:Actor {name:$name})-[:ACTED_IN]\->(m:Movie) return m")` +
will use the supplied query to retrieve data from Neo4j.

The named or indexed parameter `$param` will be substituted by the actual method parameter.
Node and relationship entities are handled directly and converted into their respective ids.
All other parameters types are provided directly (i.e. `String`, `Long`, etc.).

There is special support for the `Pageable` parameter from Spring Data Commons, which is supported to add programmatic paging and slicing
(alternatively static paging and sorting can be supplied in the query string itself).

If it is required that paged results return the correct total count, the @Query annotation can be supplied with a count query in the countQuery attribute.
This query is executed separately after the result query and its result is used to populate the number of elements on the page.

[NOTE]
====
Custom queries do not support a custom depth.
Additionally, `@Query` does not support mapping a path to domain entities, as such, a path should not be returned from a Cypher query.
Instead, return nodes and relationships to have them mapped to domain entities.
====

=== Named queries

Sometimes it makes sense to extract e.g. a long query.
Spring Data Neo4j will look in the `META-INF/neo4j-named-queries.properties` file to find named queries.
If you provide a query property like `User.findByQuery=MATCH (e) WHERE e.name=$name RETURN e` you can refer to this method by providing a finder method in your repository.
The repository has to support the given entity type (in this example `User`) and the method has to be named as the defined one (`findByQuery`).
As you can see in the example it is possible to parameterize the query.
Named count query can be specified by adding `.countQuery` suffix to the related query property key. For example, if the next query should return paged result `User.findAllByQuery=MATCH (e) RETURN e`, the count query can be specified by the following way: `User.findAllByQuery.countQuery=MATCH (e) RETURN count(e)`.

=== Query results

Typical results for queries are `Iterable<Type>`, `Iterable<Map<String,Object>>` or simply `Type`.
Nodes and relationships are converted to their respective entities (if they exist).
Other values are converted using the registered <<reference_programming-model_conversion,conversion services>> (e.g. enums).

=== Cypher examples

`MATCH (n) WHERE id(n)=9 RETURN n`::
returns the node with id 9

`MATCH (movie:Movie {title:'Matrix'}) RETURN movie`::
returns the nodes which are indexed with title equal to 'Matrix'

`MATCH (movie:Movie {title:'Matrix'})<-[:ACTS_IN]-(actor) RETURN actor.name`::
returns the names of the actors that have a ACTS_IN relationship to the movie node for 'Matrix'

`MATCH (movie:Movie {title:'Matrix'})<-[r:RATED]-(user) WHERE r.stars > 3 RETURN user.name, r.stars, r.comment`::
returns users names and their ratings (>3) of the movie titled 'Matrix'

`MATCH (user:User {name='Michael'})-[:FRIEND]-(friend)-[r:RATED]\->(movie) RETURN movie.title, AVG(r.stars), COUNT(\*) ORDER BY AVG(r.stars) DESC, COUNT(*) DESC`::
returns the movies rated by the friends of the user 'Michael', aggregated by `movie.title`, with averaged ratings and rating-counts sorted by both

Examples of Cypher queries placed on repository methods with @Query where values are replaced with method parameters,
as described in the <<reference_programming_model_annotatedQueries>>) section.

}
----

[[reference_derived-queries]]
=== Queries derived from finder-method names

Using the metadata infrastructure in the underlying object-graph mapper, a finder method name can be split into its semantic parts and converted into a cypher query.
Navigation along relationships will be reflected in the generated `MATCH` clause and properties with operators will end up as expressions in the `WHERE` clause.
The parameters will be used in the order they appear in the method signature so they should align with the expressions stated in the method name.

.Some examples of methods  of a `PersonRepository` and the Cypher queries derived from them
[source,java]
----
public interface PersonRepository extends Neo4jRepository<Person, Long> {

    // MATCH (person:Person {name=$0}) RETURN person
    Person findByName(String name);

    // MATCH (person:Person)
    // WHERE person.age = $0 AND person.married = $1
    // RETURN person
    Iterable<Person> findByAgeAndMarried(int age, boolean married);

    // MATCH (person:Person)
    // WHERE person.age = $0
    // RETURN person ORDER BY person.name SKIP $skip LIMIT $limit
    Page<Person> findByAge(int age, Pageable pageable);

    // MATCH (person:Person)
    // WHERE person.age = $0
    // RETURN person ORDER BY person.name
    List<Person> findByAge(int age, Sort sort);

    // Allow a custom depth as a parameter
    Person findByName(String name, @Depth int depth);

    // Set a fix depth of 0 for the query
    @Depth(value = 0)
    Person findBySurname(String surname);

}
----


[[reference_programming-model_mapresult]]
=== Mapping Query Results

For queries executed via `@Query` repository methods, it's possible to specify a conversion of complex query results to POJOs.
These result objects are then populated with the query result data.
Those POJOs are easier to handle and might be used as Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) as they are not attached to a `Session` and don't participate in any lifecycle.
To take advantage of this feature, use a class annotated with `@QueryResult` as the method return type.

The properties of your `@QueryResult` annotated class must have the same names as the returned values.
Please keep in mind that Java and Cypher are case-sensitive.

.Example of query result mapping
[source,java,subs="-replacements"]
----
public interface MovieRepository extends Neo4jRepository<Movie, Long> {

    @Query("MATCH (movie:Movie)-[r:RATING]->(), (movie)<-[:ACTS_IN]-(actor:Actor) " +
           "WHERE movie.id=$0 " +
           "RETURN movie as movie, COLLECT(actor) AS cast, AVG(r.stars) AS averageRating")
    MovieData getMovieData(String movieId);
}


@QueryResult
public class MovieData {
    Movie movie;
    Double averageRating;
    Set<Actor> cast;
}

[[reference_programming-model_sorting_and_paging]]

[[reference_programming-model_transactions]]
== Transactions

Neo4j is a transactional database, only allowing operations to be performed within transaction boundaries.
Spring Data Neo4j integrates nicely with both the declarative transaction support with `@Transactional` as well as the manual transaction handling with `TransactionTemplate`.

The methods on the repositories instances are transactional by default.
If you are, for example, simply just looking up an object through a repository then you do not need to define anything else:
SDN will take of everything for you.
That said, it is strongly recommended that you always annotate any service boundaries to the database with a `@Transactional` annotation.
This way all your code for that method will always run in one transaction, even if you add a write operation later on.

More standard behaviour with transactions is using a facade or service implementation that typically covers more than one repository or database call as part of a 'Unit of Work'.
Its purpose is to define transactional boundaries for non-CRUD operations:

[NOTE]
SDN only supports `PROPAGATION_REQUIRED` and `ISOLATION_DEFAULT` type transactions.

.Using an `@Service` as facade to define transaction boundaries for multiple repository calls
[source,java]
----
@Service
class UserManagementImpl implements UserManagement {

  private final UserRepository userRepository;
  private final RoleRepository roleRepository;

  @Autowired
  public UserManagementImpl(UserRepository userRepository,
    RoleRepository roleRepository) {
    this.userRepository = userRepository;
    this.roleRepository = roleRepository;
  }

  @Transactional
  public void addRoleToAllUsers(String roleName) {

    Role role = roleRepository.findByName(roleName);

    for (User user : userRepository.findAll()) {
      user.addRole(role);
      userRepository.save(user);
    }
}
----
This will cause all calls to `addRoleToAllUsers(…)` to run inside a transaction (participating in an existing one or create a new one if none already running).
The transaction configuration at the repositories will be neglected as the outer transaction configuration determines the actual one used.

It is highly recommended that users understand how Spring transactions work.
Below are some excellent resources:

* https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/data-access.html#spring-data-tier[Spring Transaction Management]
* https://graphaware.com/neo4j/2016/09/30/upgrading-to-sdn-42.html[Upgrading to Spring Data Neo4j 4.2]

=== Read only Transactions

You can start a read only transaction by marking a class or method with `@Transactional(readOnly=true)`.

[CAUTION]
Be careful when nesting transactions.
Spring's `@Transactional` propagates by default outer transactions and doesn't validate whether they are compatible with inner.
The `Neo4jTransactionManager` can be configured to validate existing transaction by calling `#setValidateExistingTransaction(true)` during bean initialization.
For more details see https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/data-access.html#tx-propagation[Spring's documentation].


=== Transaction Bound Events

SDN provides the ability to bind the listener of an event to a phase of the transaction.
The typical example is to handle the event when the transaction has completed successfully:
this allows events to be used with more flexibility when the outcome of the current transaction actually matters to the listener.

The transaction module implements an `EventListenerFactory` that looks for the new `@TransactionalEventListener` annotation.
When this one is present, an extended event listener that is aware of the transaction is registered instead of the default.

.Example: An order creation listener.
[source,java]
----
@Component
public class MyComponent {

  @TransactionalEventListener(condition = "#creationEvent.awesome")
  public void handleOrderCreatedEvent(CreationEvent<Order> creationEvent) {
    ...
  }

}
----

`@TransactionalEventListener` is a regular `@EventListener` and also exposes a `TransactionPhase`, the default being `AFTER_COMMIT`.
You can also hook other phases of the transaction (`BEFORE_COMMIT`, `AFTER_ROLLBACK` and `AFTER_COMPLETION` that is just an alias for `AFTER_COMMIT` and `AFTER_ROLLBACK`).

By default, if no transaction is running the event isn't sent at all as we can't obviously honor the requested phase,
but there is a fallbackExecution attribute in `@TransactionalEventListener` that tells Spring to invoke the listener immediately if there is no transaction.

[NOTE]
Only public methods in a managed bean can be annotated with `@EventListener` to consume events.
`@TransactionalEventListener` is the annotation that provides transaction-bound event support described here.

To find out more about Spring's Event listening capabilities see https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/beans.html#context-functionality-events-annotation[the Spring reference manual] and https://spring.io/blog/2015/02/11/better-application-events-in-spring-framework-4-2[How to build Transaction aware Eventing with Spring 4.2].

[[reference_clustering]]
== Clustering support

=== Bookmark management
Neo4j causal clusters use bookmarks to manage _read your own writes_ scenarios.
You'll find background information on the way causal clusters work in the https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/clustering/[Neo4j operations manual].

In SDN, you can use the bookmark management feature to handle these scenarios easily.
You just need to:

* Add the `@EnableBookmarkManagement` annotation once on one of your Spring configuration classes.
* Provide one bean implementing `org.springframework.data.neo4j.bookmark.BookmarkManager`. SDN supplies an implementation named `CaffeineBookmarkManager` based on the popular caching framework https://github.com/ben-manes/caffeine[Caffeine].
* Add `@UseBookmark` to each transactional Java method involved in a _read your own writes_ scenario.

A configuration using Caffeine may look like this:

[source,java]
----
@Configuration
@EnableBookmarkManagement
public class ExampleConfiguration {

    @Bean
    public BookmarkManager bookmarkManager() {
        return new CaffeineBookmarkManager();
    }
}
----

Please make sure that Caffeine is on the class path before you use this configuration.

Every method annotated with `@UseBookmark` will then collect the bookmarks coming from the database at the end of transactions.
These bookmarks are then stored into a SDN managed context, and reused on later calls to other `@UseBookmark` annotated methods.

WARNING: `@UseBookmark` has to be used on `@Transactional` annotated methods.

== Miscellaneous


=== CDI integration

Instances of the repository interfaces are usually created by a container and Spring is the most natural choice when working with Spring Data.
There's sophisticated support to easily set up Spring to create bean instances documented in <<repositories.create-instances>>.
Spring Data Neo4j ships with a custom CDI extension that allows using the repository abstraction in CDI environments.

You can now set up the infrastructure by implementing a CDI Producer for the `SessionFactory` and `Session`:

[source, java]
----
class SessionFactoryProducer {

  @Produces
  @ApplicationScoped
  public SessionFactory createSessionFactory() {
    return new SessionFactory("package");
  }

  public void close(@Disposes SessionFactory sessionFactory) {
    sessionFactory.close();
  }
}
----

The necessary setup can vary depending on the JavaEE environment you run in.
It might also just be enough to redeclare a `Session` as CDI bean as follows:

[source, java]
----
class CdiConfig {

  @Produces
  @RequestScoped
  @PersistenceContext
  public Session session;
}
----

In this example, the container has to be capable of creating Neo4j-OGM `Sessions` itself.
All the configuration does is re-exporting the Neo4j-OGM `Session` as CDI bean.

The Spring Data Neo4j CDI extension will pick up all sessions available as CDI beans and create a proxy for a Spring Data repository whenever a bean of a repository type is requested by the container.
Thus obtaining an instance of a Spring Data repository is a matter of declaring an `@Injected` property:

[source, java]
----
class RepositoryClient {

  @Inject
  PersonRepository repository;

  public void businessMethod() {
    List<Person> people = repository.findAll();
  }
}
----



=== JSR-303 (Bean Validation) Support

Spring Data Neo4j allows developers to use _JSR-303_ annotations like `@NotNull` etc. on their domain models.
While this is supported, it's not a best practice.
It is highly recommended to create _JSR-303_ annotations on actual Java Beans, similar to things like Data Transfer Objects (DTOs).

[[reference_programming-model_conversion]]
=== Conversion Service
It is possible to have Spring Data Neo4j use converters registered with https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/{springVersion}/reference/html/core.html#core-convert[Spring's ConversionService].
There must be one unique instance of a `ConversionService`-Bean in your application context to use this.
If there is more than one instance, you have to mark the one to be used by SDN with `@Primary`, otherwise an internal conversion service will be used.

When those requirements are met, use the `graphPropertyType` attribute on the `@Convert` annotation instead of specifying an `org.neo4j.ogm.typeconversion.AttributeConverter` through its `value`:

.Using graphPropertyType
[source,java]
----
@NodeEntity
public class MyEntity {

    @Convert(graphPropertyType = Integer.class)
    private DecimalCurrencyAmount fundValue;

}
----

Spring Data Neo4j will look for converters registered with Spring's ConversionService that can convert both to and from the type specified by `graphPropertyType` and use them if they exist.

[NOTE]
====
Default converters and those defined explicitly via an implementation of `org.neo4j.ogm.typeconversion.AttributeConverter`
will take precedence over converters registered with Spring's ConversionService.
====

`Neo4jRepository<T, ID>` should be the interface from which your entity repository interfaces inherit, with `T` being specified as the domain entity type to persist.
`ID` is defined by the field type annotated with `@Id`.

Examples of methods you get for free out of `Neo4jRepository` are as follows.
For all of these examples the `ID` parameter is a `Long` that matches the graph id:

Load an entity instance via an id::
`Optional<T> findById(id)`

Check for existence of an id in the graph::
`boolean existsById(id)`

Iterate over all nodes of a node entity type::
`Iterable<T> findAll()`
`Iterable<T> findAll(Sort ...)`
`Page<T> findAll(Pageable ...)`

Count the instances of the repository entity type::
`Long count()`

Save entities::
`T save(T)` and `Iterable<T> saveAll(Iterable<T>)`

Delete graph entities::
`void delete(T)`, `void deleteAll(Iterable<T>)`, and `void deleteAll()`

[NOTE]
For users coming from versions before `4.2.x`, `Neo4jRepository` has replaced `GraphRepository` but essentially has the same features.
